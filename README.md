# 🤖 **QuickBot-Chat** - Function-Based Conversational Assistant

Note: The source code for this project has been made private intentionally.

**QuickBot-Chat** is a lightweight, function-driven chatbot designed for structured, hierarchical question-answering.  
Built for simplicity and clarity, **QuickBot-Chat** helps users find answers by guiding them through **categories**, **subcategories**, and **specific questions**, ensuring a smooth and organized experience.

---

## 📚 **How It Works**

1. **Category Selection** 🗂️  
   The chatbot first prompts the user to select a **main category** (e.g., "Science", "Mathematics", "Technology").

2. **Subcategory Selection** 📂  
   After the user picks a category, the chatbot asks for a **subcategory** related to the chosen field (e.g., "Physics" under "Science").

3. **Question Selection** ❓  
   Once a subcategory is selected, the chatbot displays available **questions** within that subtopic.

4. **Answer Display** ✅  
   After the user selects a question, the chatbot provides the corresponding **answer** instantly.
